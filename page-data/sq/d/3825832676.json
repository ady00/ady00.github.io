One of my first attempts at clearly and thoroughly documenting my thoughts during the modeling and data-cleaning phases. I utilized a number of models such as support vector machines, logistic and multilinear regression, k-nearest neighbors, and decision trees to analyze each of their efficiencies at this paticular dataset.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Exoplanet Habitability Research","tech":["Seaborn","sklearn","numpy","Pandas","Supervised Learning Models","Unsupervised Learning Models"],"github":"","external":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OmnKu56Q7I-5Tw-ZX2gX7P3JS4HhZxxZ/view?usp=sharing"},"html":"<p>A series of ML models using supervised and unsupervised methods in order to detect exoplanets that are contenders for sustaining life.
