A prediction model I created during Kaggle's Titanic Prediction competition to analyze the survivability of passengers aboard the Titanic using weights such as gender, cabin, age, family aboard, fare, and more. One of my first attempts at clearly and thoroughly documenting my thoughts during the modeling and data-cleaning phases. I utilized a number of models such as support vector machines, logistic and multilinear regression, k-nearest neighbors, and decision trees to analyze each of their efficiencies at this paticular dataset.
