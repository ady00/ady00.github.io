A notebook to study the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks at image recognition, via a massive dataset consisting of a variety of clothing articles and benchmarking the model's capability of classifying them. After a testing period of 50 epochs and the addition of numerous dropout layers to combat overfitting, I ended with an overall accuracy of 93.4%, which could have easily been improved with further tweaking.
