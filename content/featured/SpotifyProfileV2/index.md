A custom smart screen built using a dissected monitor and a Raspberry Pi 2. 

The smart screen utilizes face-recognition to bring up a unique home screen, with a basic guest screen if the face is not recognized. The screen takes in voice commands, and is able to show me security camera footage, play any song on my Spotify playlist, or search questions on Google and StackOverflow. The GUI frontend is built using PyQt5.
